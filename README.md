# Koalagator Browser Extension

This browser extension makes it easy to add events from supported event sites.
Suppported events sites have mapping files in /mappings.

(Version 1 currently only submits to one instance of koalagator)

One click and a create event page is opened in a new tab, filled out with all the event details.

You're then able to review and edit before saving the event.

## Supported event sites

We aim to support all major event website used by community organisers.
(Concert and major sporting events ticketing are not the focus of this extension)

Supported: Humanitix, Eventbrite, Meetup, Trybooking, Tito, Luma
Coming soon: Facebook

To add additional sites or to fix a data collection field, make changes in content-script.js

Here's an example of how humanitix is processed. Note: We also process the date based on schema.org if this json is present

    // example from content-script.js
    const humanitix = {
        domain_name: "events.humanitix.com",
        event_title: "[data-testid='title']",
        venue_name: ".detail.location .f-label-3",
        description: ".EventDescription .RichContent",![Uploading SCR-20250505-unqz.pngâ€¦]()

        date_start: ".detail.datetime time",
        date_start_attr: 'datetime'
    }
